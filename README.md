Hello every one!

This is a movie simulation system where the user will need to register him self in the system, register some movies that he likes and
after that the programm will check the films he like and return some other films as a recomendation for him

The programm check what he likes based in the gender of the film, the director, if the film have a sequence or it's unique and some other things

Those filters have an order of priority.

The project has been developed only using Python
